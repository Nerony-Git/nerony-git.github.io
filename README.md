# Portfolio Page with CSS Animations

## Overview
This project is a personal portfolio page designed using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It showcases various sections like Home, Education, Services, Projects, About, and Contact, along with CSS animations to enhance the user experience. The goal is to create an interactive and visually appealing portfolio to present personal achievements and projects.

## Features
- **Responsive Design**: The portfolio is fully responsive, ensuring a smooth experience across different screen sizes.
- **CSS Animations**: Elements such as images and text are animated using `@keyframes`, adding effects like zoom-in, fade-in, and bounce.
- **Navigation Bar**: A dynamic navigation bar with smooth scrolling and active state indicators.
- **Dark/Light Mode Toggle**: Users can switch between dark and light themes with a simple toggle button, offering a personalized viewing experience.
- **Interactive Elements**: Hover effects and animations trigger on interaction, making the portfolio more engaging.
- **Modern Layout with Flexbox and Grid**: The layout is structured using CSS Flexbox and Grid for clean and adaptable designs.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: For structuring the content and semantic elements.
- **CSS3**: For styling, animations, and responsiveness.
- **JavaScript**: To add interactivity, like toggling dark/light mode.

## Key Learning Areas
1. **CSS Animations & Keyframes**: Created dynamic transitions, like zooming, bouncing, and fading, using `@keyframes`.
2. **Responsive Design**: Used media queries and modern CSS layout techniques like Flexbox and Grid for responsiveness.
3. **JavaScript Interactions**: Implemented theme toggles and smooth scrolling, improving user engagement.
4. **Dark/Light Mode**: Learned how to switch themes dynamically by altering CSS variables with JavaScript.

## Future Enhancements
In future iterations, I would like to:
- Integrate **JavaScript-powered animations** for more interactive components.
- Experiment with **3D CSS transformations** for a more modern look.
- Add **scroll-triggered animations** to engage users as they navigate through different sections.
